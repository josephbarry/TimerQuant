\section{Model definition}

The fluorophore maturation kinetics was described as a one-step process. Each 
fluorescence channel was modelled separately but due to tandem timer design 
each channel shared the same constant protein production rate $p$ and constant 
degradation rate $k$. The time-dependent rate equations used are therefore
\begin{equation}
    \begin{array}{lcl}
        \dot{X_i^0}(t) & = & p-(k+m_i)X_i^0(t) \\
        \dot{X_i}(t) & = & m_iX_i^0(t)-kX_i(t)
    \end{array}
\label{eq:ODE}
\end{equation}
\noindent
where $X_i^0(t)$ and $X_i(t)$ are the molecular populations of the non-mature 
and mature fluorophore populations respectively at time $t$ for the $i$th 
fluorescence channel with $i\in\{1, 2\}$. We chose the convention that $i=1$ 
is the fast-maturing fluorescence channel and $i=2$ is the slow-maturing 
fluorescence channel.

\section{Model solutions}

The time-dependent solutions to eq. \ref{eq:ODE} with the boundary conditions 
$X_i^0(0)=0$ and $X_i(0)=0$ were calculated to be
\begin{equation}
    \begin{array}{lcl}
        X_i^0(t) & = & p(1-e^{-(k+m_i)t})/(k+m_i) \\
        X_i(t) & = & pe^{-(k+m_i)t}(k-e^{m_it}(k+m_i-e^{kt}m_i))/(k(k+m_i))\ .
    \end{array}
\label{eq:ODEsolutionTime}    
\end{equation}

The corresponding steady state solutions to eq. \ref{eq:ODEsolutionTime} are
\begin{equation}
    \begin{array}{lcl}
        \lim_{t\to\infty}X_i^0(t) & = & p/(k+m_i) \\
        \lim_{t\to\infty}X_i(t) & = & pm_i/(k(k+m_i))\ .
    \end{array}
\label{eq:ODEsteadyState}
\end{equation}

\section{Timer ratio with FRET}

Fluorescence intensity $I_i$ is proportional to the number of mature fluorescent 
molecules $X_i$. If FRET occurs between channel $1$ and channel $2$ the
fluorescence intensity of channel $1$ will be reduced by an amount proportional
to the FRET efficiency $E$ and the proportion $b$ of channel 2 fluorophores 
available as acceptors. In the time-dependent model this was described as
\begin{equation}
    \begin{array}{lcl}
        I_1(t) & = & f_1X_1(t)(1-b(t)E) \\
        I_2(t) & = & f_2X_2(t)
    \end{array}
\label{eq:fluorescenceIntensities}
\end{equation}
\noindent
where the proportionality constant $f_i$ incorporates multiplicative effects 
such as fluorophore brightness and quantum yield, and 
$b(t)=X_2(t)/(X_2^0(t)+X_2(t))$. We did not consider FRET from channel $2$ to channel $1$ 
since it is physiologically improbable to encounter such cases as slower-maturing 
fluorophores tend to have longer wavelengths than faster-maturing fluorophores.

The time-dependent timer ratio $R$ incorporating FRET was defined as
\begin{equation}
    R(t)=I_2(t)/I_1(t)=fX_2(t)/(X_1(t)(1-b(t)E))
\end{equation}
where $f=f_2/f_1$.

In full the the timer ratio is therefore
\begin{equation}
    R(t)=f\frac{e^{(m_1-m_2)t}(k+m_1)(k-e^{m_2t}(k+m_2-e^{kt}m_2))}{(k-e^{m_1t}(k+m_1-e^{kt}m_1))(k+m_2)(1-E\frac{k-e^{-m_2t}k+m_2-e^{kt}m_2}{(1-e^{kt})(k+m_2)})}
\end{equation}
\noindent
, which in steady state reduces to
\begin{equation}
    \lim_{t\to\infty}R(t)=f\frac{m_2(k+m_1)}{m_1(k+m_2-Em_2)}\ .
\end{equation}

\section{Time to reach steady state}

The time to reach steady state for the ratio was determined from the kinetics of the 
slower maturing fluorophore, FP2. Since FP2 is not affected by FRET from FP1 we 
may calculate this either from the fluorescence intensity in eq.
\ref{eq:fluorescenceIntensities} or the molecular population in eq. 
\ref{eq:ODEsolutionTime}. Here we focus on the latter. We choose to define 
the time to reach steady-state as the point of intersection chose the line tangent 
to the point of inflection and the steady state value (see Fig. S4A) given by 
eq. \ref{eq:ODEsteadyState}. The time coordinate $t^*$ at the point of inflection 
was calculated to be
\noindent
\begin{equation}
    t^*=(1/m_2)\log(1+m_2/k)\ .
\end{equation}
\noindent
The slope $s$ of the tangent to the FP2 profile is given by
\begin{equation}
    s=pm_2(1+m_2/k)^{k/m_2}/(k+m_2)\ .
\end{equation}
Calculating the point of intersection between the tangent line and the steady 
state value led to the following definition for the time to reach steady 
state, $T_{ss}$.

\begin{equation}
    T_{ss}=1/k+1/(k+m_2)+\log(1+m_2/k)/m_2
\end{equation}

\section{Timer signal}

The timer signal was defined between two protein 
half-lives, $T_{1/2}^A$ and $T_{1/2}^B$ where $T_{1/2}^B>T_{1/2}^A$ . 
We considered the log fold-change between the corresponding timer ratios $R^B=I_2^B/I_1^B$ and 
$R^A=I_2^A/I_1^A$.

To investigate the effect of background noise on our ability to detect differences 
in timer signal we defined the following additive error model.

\begin{equation}
    S=\log_2\bigg(\frac{I_2^B+\epsilon_2^B}{I_1^B+\epsilon_1^B}\bigg/\frac{I_2^A+\epsilon_2^A}{I_1^A+\epsilon_1^A}\bigg)
\end{equation}
\noindent
where $\epsilon_1^A,\epsilon_2^A,\epsilon_1^B,\epsilon_2^B\sim N(0,\sigma^2)$ are 
independent. Computer simulations were used to obtain an estimate of the 
population mean $\mu_S$ and standard deviation $\sigma_S$. From this we formed 
the coefficient of variation term

\begin{equation}
    CV=\sigma_S/\mu_S\ .
\label{eq:statistic}
\end{equation}

\section{Timer signal and FRET}

To explain why an increase in FRET increases timer timer signal we considered 
timer signal without additive noise and denoted
timer signal without FRET ($E=0$) as $D_0$ and timer signal with positive
FRET ($E>0$) as $D_E$. We calculated that

\begin{equation}
    D_E/D_0 = 1+\frac{1}{D_0}\log_2\bigg(\frac{1-b^AE}{1-b^BE}\bigg)
\label{eq:timerSignalFRET}
\end{equation}
\noindent
where $b^A$ and $b^B$ are the proportions of FP2 fluorophores available as 
acceptors for the shorter-living and longer-living proteins, respectively. 
Since the population of mature FP2 fluorophores is relatively more abundant for 
the long-living protein, $b^B>b^A$, which implies that $1-b^BE<1-b^AE$. 
Therefore $\log_2((1-b^AE)/(1-b^BE))$ is a positive quantity and  
eq. \ref{eq:timerSignalFRET} is greater than one.
